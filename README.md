# Clash-Royale-Artificial-Intelligence
An AI for mobile game trained via reinforcement learning for College Project.
This software can battle for you if you can emulate the game on windows (this is against the game's code of conduct and may lead to your account getting banned). This software is by no means finished or optimized, This is just a minor project.



## How to run

#### Requirements
- Windows OS
- Python 3+
  - Pygame
  - tensorflow
  - keras
  - pyautogui
  - opencv
- Any Android Emulator (BlueStacks recommended)
- Make sure emulator is at lowest resolution possible and positioned at top left corner of your screen

Clone the repository. And run the game in emulator then position it top left corner of screen, run [main.py](/main.py). Postion the windows so that emulator is clearly visible.
Start the battle and select the pygame window then press 'S' to start the AI.


### How to use

After Pressing 'S' key to start pyautogui will take control of mouse input and fight your opponent. To stop the program you can push your mouse to extreme corner of your screen whenever you can.

Or you can sit back and watch AI lose (yes it's pretty bad).
